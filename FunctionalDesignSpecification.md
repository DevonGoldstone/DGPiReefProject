This document is intended to expand on the Customer Requirements Specification in order to identify the 'Project Wet Spot' Functional Requirements
###  1.2 Scope of document
This document lists the required functionality for 'Project Wet Spot' as well as to capture the technology and means to be used in realising this functionality. 
###  1.3 Reference documents
The documents listed in the Customer Requirements Specification have been used as reference materials for this specification. 
Where information has been gathered from external sources, this will be cited in the text
###	1.4 Constraints, Assumptions, and Dependencies
####  1.4.1 Constraints
The System will work with an Innovative Marine Fusion Nano 20 fishtank and TMC Aquarium V2 power pump 800.
