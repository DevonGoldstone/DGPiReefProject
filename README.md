# Project Wet Spot

### @devongoldstone

This repo is going to be written in C
The intention is to build a bare metal raspberry pi OS based on https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os

The project will cover both hardware and software and will track my project and enable me to base my dissertation on this work

The intention will be to create a two-tier Raspberry Pi, tier 1 will be monitor systems and tier 2 will be control systems. 

I have not yet decided whether I want these on two separate Pis or on one Pi
